## Overview

ZXTX (Zipped & eXtended Text eXchange) is a file format designed for secure, compressed text storage. It supports metadata embedding, lossless compression, optional symmetric encryption, and optional cryptographic signing.

## Byte Layout (Low-Level)

#### A `.zxtx` file consists of the following sections in sequence

| Field                 | Size (bytes) | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Magic Number          | 4            | `b'ZXTX'` â€” identifies this file format                                    |
| Version               | 2            | Format version: 1 byte minor, 1 byte major (e.g. v1.0 = `0x01 0x00`)       |
| UID                   | 16           | Unique file ID (UUID v4)                                                   |
| Compression Method ID | 1            | Enum for compression algorithm used                                        |
| Cipher Method ID      | 1            | Enum for cipher/obfuscation algorithm used                                 |
| Original Size         | 8            | Original uncompressed text size (uint64)                                   |
| Compressed Size       | 8            | Compressed data size (uint64)                                              |
| Timestamp             | 8            | UNIX timestamp (double) when file was created                              |
| SHA-256 Hash          | 32           | SHA-256 hash of the original uncompressed text                             |
| CRC32 Checksum        | 4            | CRC32 checksum of the compressed data                                      |
| Certificate Length    | 2            | Length in bytes of the certificate field (uint16)                          |
| Certificate Data      | Variable     | X.509 or custom certificate for verifying signer                           |
| Signature Length      | 2            | Length in bytes of the digital signature (uint16)                          |
| Signature             | Variable     | Signature over header + all fields except compressed data for authenticity |
| Compressed Data       | Variable     | Actual compressed (and possibly encrypted) data                            |
